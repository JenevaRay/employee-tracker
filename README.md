# Employee-Manager
## Description
This is an employee management system that allows for organizational structuring and restructuring, promotions, firing, and more.
- I wanted to learn how to utilize classic SQL better.
- Because employee management of all forms matter
- Efficient management of organizational structure and employee data, utilizing related but independent data.
- I learned that SQL is not something to be avoided, but is another tool in my toolbox.  I still think I prefer NoSQL more though.
